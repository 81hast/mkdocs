Material Components is a Material theme for the markdown flavored documentation engine  [MkDocs][1].
It forks from the excellent [MkDocs-Material][2] theme and uses Google's [Material Components Web][3]as the base.

  [2]: http://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/
  [3]: https://material.io/components/web/

The goals with this project are 3 fold

1. build on top of Material Components Web
2. Extend the markdown so its easy for the author to use cards, callouts and admonitions with simple emojis as instructions
3. Make it easy to embed from other webapps like Office 365, Evernote, lucid charts, etc..

For install instructions see the [Install & Config](docs/getting-started.md) section.
