# Tutorials

In addition to the basic getting started guides, we offer tutorials that aim to
show how you can use Material for MkDocs in different use cases. In contrast to
the getting started guides or the reference documentation, the tutorials show
the breadth of features available in Material for MkDocs but also within
the wider MkDocs ecosystem.

## Tutorial structure

The tutorials guide you through worked examples, so following them you should
gain not only an understanding of how to use Material for MkDocs, but also
a template for your own projects. For convenience, these templates are also
available as [template repositories on GitHub].

<!-- TODO -->
[template repositories on GitHub]: templates.md

Each tutorial is a single page, so use the Table of Contents navigation to move
between steps. They start by mentioning prerequisites, giving an
overview of the content as well as describing the outcomes.

### Instructions

Tutorials contain a mix of explanation, demonstrations, and instructions that you
should follow as you work your way through the individual steps. Those instructions
come in the form of admonitions to separate them from the rest of the
tutorial:

!!! example "Instructions to follow"

    Whenever you see a box  like this you know it is time to get hands on and
    apply material just covered as well as reflect on how you would it in your
    work work.

### Tips and warnings

Likewise, helpful tips and warnings appear in boxes of their own:

!!! tip "A hot tip!"

    Tips look like this...

!!! warning "Warning!"

    ...and warnings like this!

## Feedback wanted

The tutorials are a recent addition to our documentation and we are still
working out what shape they should have in the end. Please contact us if you
want to provide feedback. <!--- TODO: how? -->

Note, however, that suggestions should be specific and feasible. We want to
focus on creating more content at the moment, instead of developing a specific
styling or behaviour for the tutorials. If there are worthwhile improvements
that we can make through simple customization then we are happy to consider those.
