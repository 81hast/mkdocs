# Welcome to ObserveRTC

ObserverRTC is an open source framework for monitoring WebRTC services. 

We are in the process of documenting this project - please check back often.

See our [integrations](https://github.com/ObserveRTC/integrations) for quick use with [Jitsi Meet](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet) and Tokbox/Vonage/Nexmo [Opentok](https://github.com/opentok). 

See [here](https://github.com/ObserveRTC/WebRTC-Deployments) for deploying the infrastructure with docker-compose.
